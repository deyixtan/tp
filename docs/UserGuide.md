# BudgetBaby User Guide :baby: :money_with_wings:

**BudgetBaby** is a **budget and expenses tracking desktop app for University students and/or those who are looking to
better manage their finances**. It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) so that entering and
editing financial records and budgets can be done faster by typing in commands while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). This document aims to guide users in using BudgetBaby, providing a complete summary of
the functions and intended usage of the application.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are arguments which must be supplied by you when you type in a command.<br>
  For example, in the command `add-fr d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT`, `FR_DESCRIPTION` and `FR_AMOUNT` are arguments
  which must be supplied by you. An example of supplied arguments look like this `add-fr d/Lunch a/10`.

- You may choose to omit items in square brackets as they are optional.<br>
  For example, with the command `add-fr d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT [t/DATE] [c/CATEGORY]…`, you may omit the category and
  use `add-fr d/Lunch a/10 t/01-01-2021 c/food` or `add-fr d/Lunch a/10`.

- For items suffixed with `…`​ you may repeat it multiple times within the command.<br>
  For example, with the command `add-fr d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT [t/DATE] [c/CATEGORY]…`, you may repeat `[c/FR_CATEGORY]…​` multiple
  times with `c/food`, `c/transportation`, `c/shopping` etc.

- You may key in arguments in any order.<br>
  For example, you can use `d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT` or `a/FR_AMOUNT d/FR_DESCRIPTION` as both are acceptable.

- If an argument is expected only once in the command, but you specify multiple arguments, only the last occurrence of
  the argument is used.<br>
  For example, if you specify `d/Lunch d/Dinner`, only `d/Dinner` will be used.

- If you key in extraneous arguments for commands that do not take in arguments (such as `reset-filter`, `help` and `exit`),
  they will be ignored.<br>
  For example, if you specify `reset-filter 123`, it will be interpreted as `reset-filter`.

- If you key in extraneous spaces before or after an argument, these spaces will be trimmed. 
  If you key in multiple spaces in the middle of an argument that takes in text (such as `FR_DESCRIPTION` and `CATEGORY`), 
  these multiple spaces will be compressed into one space.<br>
  For example, if you specify `add-fr d/ bubble    tea  a/10.0 c/ food   `, 
  it will be interpreted as `add-fr d/bubble tea a/10.0 c/food`.

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

[coming in v1.3]

If this is your first time opening BudgetBaby, or if you have forgotten what commands you can use, you may utilise the `help`
command to access the help page for a detailed guide on using the application.

<img src="images/helpMessage.png" width="600px">

Format: `help`

**:bulb: Tips:**<br>

</div>

### Adding a financial record : `add-fr`

If you just spent some money and want to record it, you may use the `add-fr` command to add this expenditure as a financial record in BudgetBaby.

<img src="images/features/add-fr.png" width="1000px">

Format: `add-fr d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT [t/DATE] [c/CATEGORY]…`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tips:** <br>

- You must replace `FR_DESCRIPTION` with the description of your financial record. The description should not exceed 100 characters and it should contain special character "/".
- You must replace `FR_AMOUNT` with a **positive number** containing up to **two decimal places**. The upper limit for `FR_AMOUNT`is 1,000,000.
- If you key in additional decimal places for `FR_AMOUNT`, it will be rounded to two decimal places, and the value after rounding
must be within the valid range (between 0 to 1,000,000). For example, `0.001` will be rejected, as it will be rounded to `0.00`(not positive).
- You may include more than 1 `CATEGORY`, but each of it should not exceed 20 characters
- You may replace `Date` following the format `DD-MM-YYYY` and it must be a date between 01-01-1970 and 31-12-2100. (e.g. 31-12-2020)
- In the above format for the date `DD-MM-YYYY`, `DD` is the numeric value of the date, `MM` is the numeric value of the month 
and `YYYY` is the numeric value of the year. You must use a date number `DD` with 2 digits, a month number `MM` with 2 digits, 
and a year number `YYYY` with 4 digits.

If you mistyped a financial record or added a financial record incorrectly, you may use the `delete-fr` command to delete a financial record from BudgetBaby.

<img src="images/features/delete-fr.png" width="600px">

Format: `delete-fr FR_INDEX [FR_INDEX]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tips:**<br>

- You may include more than 1 `FR_INDEX` after the command to delete multiple financial records.
- You must replace `FR_INDEX` with the index of the financial record you want to delete.
- `FR_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed financial record list.
- `FR_INDEX` must be a **positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​)

</div>

Examples:

- `delete-fr 10` deletes the 10th financial record displaying on the screen

### Editing a financial record : `edit-fr`

If you mistyped the details of a financial record, instead of deleting it completely, you may use the `edit-fr` command to edit an existing financial record in BudgetBaby.

<img src="images/features/edit-fr.png" width="600px">

Format: `edit-fr FR_INDEX [d/FR_DESCRIPTION] [a/FR_AMOUNT] [t/DATE] [c/CATEGORY]...`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bulb: Tips:**<br>

- You must replace `FR_INDEX` with the index of the financial record you want to delete.
- `FR_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed financial record list.
- `FR_INDEX` must be a **positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​)
- Existing values will be overwritten by the input values. For example, if you include `c/` in your `èdit-fr`
command, all existing categories will be replaced by the new input categories.
- Use `c/` (leave `CATEGORY` blank) to completely remove existing categories of a record.
- For the specifications on `FR_DESCRIPTION`, `FR_AMOUNT`, `DATE` and `CATEGORY`, please refer to `add-fr` command.

</div>

Examples:

- `edit-fr 1 d/new description` changes the description of the first financial record displaying on the screen to `new description`.

must be within the valid range (between 0 to 1,000,000).
